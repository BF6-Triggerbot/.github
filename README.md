## **What is a Triggerbot in Battlefield 6?**

A triggerbot is like having a **robotic trigger finger** that never misses the moment to fire. Instead of manually clicking, the triggerbot scans your crosshair position and shoots the instant it aligns with a valid enemy target. This is especially deadly for **snipers holding angles**, or close-range players who want to melt enemies before they can react.

## **Triggerbot vs. Aimbot in BF6**

While an **aimbot** moves your crosshair automatically, a **triggerbot** only controls your firing. This means your aim stays naturalâ€”perfect for players who already have decent accuracy but want **faster reaction shots**. A triggerbot can be stealthier, since it doesnâ€™t create obvious snapping movements like aimbots do.
